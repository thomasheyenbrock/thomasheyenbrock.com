    <h1>The Journey to GraphiQL v2: The Next Generation of GraphQL IDEs</h1>
    <p>
      There's no denying the incredible impact of GraphiQL on the GraphQL
      ecosystem. From the inception of GraphQL, GraphiQL allowed developers to
      explore GraphQL right from their browser, a game-changer for developer
      productivity and a core driver for the adoption and success of GraphQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple, lean, and user-friendly interface of GraphiQL helped
      developers learn GraphQL. It had built-in schema documentation, editor
      auto-completion, and a split view where you write your GraphQL operation
      on the left and see its result on the right. This made GraphQL intuitive
      and enabled engineers to rapidly develop a mental model for understanding
      it.

    /></a>

    <h2>Why GraphiQL needed to evolve</h2>
    <p>
      Over the years, GraphQL gained more traction, its ecosystem grew, and the
      developers who used GraphiQL to learn GraphQL became power users.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, GraphiQL stayed pretty much the same, with only minor changes to
      adapt to the evolving GraphQL specification.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other IDEs became popular that supported a wider range of use cases, the
      most notable being the GraphQL Playground. It featured tabs, allowed
      exploring the schema through SDL, supported customization options, and had
      a more modern design. It was so successful that it was eventually handed
      over to the GraphQL Foundation.
    </p>
    <a href="graphql-playground.png">
      <img
        src="graphql-playground.png"
        alt="A screenshot of the GraphQL Playground UI"
        style="width: 100%"
    /></a>
    <p>
      That kicked of a process of modernizing GraphiQL, making it a true
      reference implementation of GraphQL IDEs. As part of Stellate's commitment
      to the growth of the GraphQL ecosystem, I had the opportunity of using my
      working hours to lead this effort, working together with other GraphiQL
      maintainers such as
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/rikkischulte/">Rikki</a>,
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathanawesome/">Jonathan</a>, and
      <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/postolov/">Dimitri</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>Introducing GraphiQL v2</h2>
    <a href="graphiql-v2.png">
      <img
        src="graphiql-v2.png"
        alt="A screenshot of the GraphiQL UI for the second major version, commonly called 'v2'"
        style="width: 100%"
    /></a>
    <p>
      The most obvious things to improve were the design and layout of GraphiQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the redesign, we introduced a new color palette, including a dark
      mode. Color contrasts and font sizes were chosen to improve legibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      The layout was changed to be more in line with common IDE layouts, like
      VSCode or other code editors. A sidebar was introduced at the left side of
      the screen, which can expand into a plugin pane. This is where schema
      documentation and operation history were moved. The split view with a
      query editor on the left and a result view on the right remained in place.
    </p>

    <h2>The Power of Plugins</h2>
    <p>
      Perhaps one of the most exciting features of GraphiQL v2 is its plugin
      system. The plugin pane mentioned above is able to host custom plugins, a
      list of which can be specified by the host of the GraphiQL instance. These
      plugins can offer additional functionality by rendering their own UI and
      being able to hook into the overall state of GraphiQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Internally, we achieve this by breaking up the monolithic application
      structure of GraphiQL v1 into reusable building blocks. We bundled those
      in a new NPM package called <code>@graphiql/react</code>, which exposes
      common UI primitives (e.g. a <code>Button</code> component), stateful
      chunks of the GraphiQL UI (e.g. a <code>QueryEditor</code> component), and
      the underlying React Context providers and consumers to read from and
      modify the internal state of GraphiQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      A great example for such a plugin is the GraphiQL Explorer. This plugin
      was already popular with GraphiQL v1 and allows users to visually build
      queries by selecting fields and operations from a menu. However, instead
      of having to wrap the GraphiQL UI (what the plugin did for GraphiQL v1),
      in v2 the GraphQL Explorer plugin is directly integrated into the IDE,
      improving the overall IDE layout.
    </p>
    <a href="graphiql-explorer.png">
      <img
        src="graphiql-explorer.png"
        alt="A screenshot of the GraphiQL UI with the sidebar showing the 'GraphiQL Explorer' plugin UI"
        style="width: 100%"
    /></a>

    <h2>Customization without limits</h2>
    <p>
      The creation of <code>@graphiql/react</code> had one more benefit: It now
      allows everybody to create their own GraphQL IDE with ease. Simply take
      the building blocks, arranging them in a different order, and add or
      remove the parts you (don't) need.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allowed us GraphiQL maintainers to have the best of both worlds:
      Provide a sustainable reference implementation <em>and</em> allowing users
      to implement their specific use-cases without having to build everything
      first-class into GraphiQL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here at Stellate, we made use of this and created a lean version of
      GraphiQL that is integrated into our dashboard, which adds information
      specific to our product like the cache status of the request.
    </p>

      <img
        src="embedded-graphiql.png"
        alt="A screenshot of a custom GraphQL IDE embedded into the Stellate dashboard"
        style="width: 100%"
      />
    </a>

    <h2>The Success of GraphiQL v2</h2>
    <p>
      GraphiQL v2 was released as only the second major version of GraphiQL in
      August 2022, exactly 7 years after the inception of GraphiQL. It was a
      significant leap forward, and since its release, it has seen widespread
      adoption in most major GraphQL server frameworks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course, the journey doesn't end there. We are exploring further
      improvements, like integrating Monaco, the code editor that powers VS
      Code, to provide a more familiar editing experience and better
      accessibility. Also expanding the plugin system is something we have in
      mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In conclusion, GraphiQL v2 represents a new era of GraphQL IDEs, offering
      more flexibility, customizability, and an improved user experience. The
      future of GraphQL IDEs is here, and we can't wait to see what developers
      worldwide will create with these new capabilities.
