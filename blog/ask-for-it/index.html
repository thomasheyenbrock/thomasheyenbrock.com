    <h1>If you want something, ask for it</h1>

    <p>
      I had a side job at a small company in Munich while I was still in
      university. I did good, and I liked the company a lot, so the co-founder
      of the company (who was my direct manager at the time) offered me a full
      time job after I graduated.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was excited when I got the draft contract including the salary number.
      It was a good number. Not exorbitantly high, but it felt right to me as it
      was my first job. So I accepted the offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      I can vividly remember the chat with my boss when I let him know. We shook
      hands and we were both very happy about my decision. On the way out of the
      meeting room, he said something to me: "You know, Thomas, if you want
      something just ask me for it."
    </p>

    <p>
      That stuck with me ever since. Was he just trying to close the
      conversation? I don't think so.
    </p>

    <p>
      I believe it was a subtle hint that I could have negotiated a better
      offer. Whereas I didn't even try.
    </p>

    <p>
      And this is not just good advice for offer negotiation. It holds true for
      life.
    </p>

    <p>
      After all, what's the worst thing that could happen when asking for
      something? It's a "no". Will that make it less likely you get what you
      want? Maybe, in the short term, but I argue it actually increases your
      chances to get what you want <em>significantly</em> in the mid- to
      long-term.
    </p>

    <p>
      There's one important detail to note: <em>Asking</em> is not the same as
      <em>demanding</em>. If you want something and you demand to have it, it
      puts the receiver on the defensive. You're acting like there are two
      opponents in this conversation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, be kind and <em>ask</em>. Try not to force the other person to
      give you what you want, but make them your partner. Figure out a way how
      to get it, together.
    </p>

    <p>
      No other person can read your mind. If you don't speak out loud what you
      want, it's more likely you'll end up feeling disappointed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead, be open. Be transparent. If you have a need that only somebody
      else can fulfill, ask them for it.
    </p>
