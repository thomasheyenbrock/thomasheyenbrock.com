    <h1>Thomas Heyenbrock</h1>
    <p>
      Hello Internet! My name is Thomas and I am many things. My current
      profession is Software Engineering, and I have a lot of other interests,
      skills, and experiences.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated in Mathematics, played the piano for over 20 years, built my
      own electric guitar, crossed the alps from north to south by bike twice,
      and I train skiing instructors.
    </p>
    <p>

    <h2>About this website</h2>
    <p>
      You might have noticed that this website looks quite plain. That's because
      it is, intentionally.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do know how to use the most performant frameworks and the most slick
      style libraries and the funkiest fonts. But would it really make this
      website so much better?
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple purpose of this website to show text and link to external
      platforms. Just HTML with a tiny bit of CSS does that <em>perfectly</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'd rather use the time for something more impactful. Simplicity for the
      win.
